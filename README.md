# Neptune
Neptune is an education project where I will try to build a containerized nano-service that productizes a machine learning model. The project will include the following:

1. A machine learning training workbook that makes proper use of sklearn's pipeline and gridsearch tools.
2. A serialized machine learning model stored on S3
3. A very simple Flask app that will function as REST API.
4. The app will be containerized using Docker
5. The app will be deployed on an AWS EC2 instance

## To Do
* Create S3 bucket on AWS
